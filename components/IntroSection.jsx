              Fashion and technology, a long time ago, no one could have imagined that these two fields would be linked together. 
              But with the development of technology and the rapid change of fashion trends, the need for retailers and fashion designers 
              to update fashion trends in a timely manner is becoming more and more urgent, which is the reason for the birth of this system.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              With this system, you can categorize your clothes into 7 pre-defined categories: Casual, Major Brand, Traditional, Publications,
               Runway, and next to them are No-Clothes and Messy Clothes (or Trash).

              Besides, because I understand the competition of every stitch, creativity, style, etc. in the fashion industry,
               the system will only run the analysis and the results as well as your images will not be saved to prevent information leakage,
